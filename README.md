# House_Price_Prediction
This project is an end-to-end solution for the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle competition. The goal of the competition is to predict final house sale prices based on a rich dataset of property features.

## Project Overview
This project implements a complete workflow for the Kaggle House Prices competition. It covers:

Data exploration and visualization
Data cleaning and missing value imputation
Feature engineering (including encoding categorical variables)
Building a baseline model using linear regression
Generating predictions on the test set
Preparing the submission file for Kaggle

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:

train.csv: Contains training data with features and the target variable (SalePrice).
test.csv: Contains the test data with features but without the target variable.
sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file showing the required format.
data_description.txt: Detailed description of each feature in the dataset.
You can download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Recommended libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn
Setup
Clone the repository:

### bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-prices-project.git
cd house-prices-project
Install the required packages:

### bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place the dataset files (train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv, and data_description.txt) in the project directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The initial analysis involves:

Loading the data: Reading CSV files using pandas.
Summary statistics: Checking the shape, data types, and basic statistics.
Missing values analysis: Identifying columns with missing data.
Correlation analysis: Visualizing the correlation matrix for numeric features to understand relationships with SalePrice.
Distribution plots: Plotting the distribution of the target variable.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Preprocessing steps include:

Missing value imputation: Filling missing numerical values with the median and categorical values with the mode.
Encoding categorical variables: Using one-hot encoding to convert categorical data to a numerical format.
Feature creation: Optionally creating new features (like total living area or house age) to improve model performance.
Example code snippets are provided in the repository for these tasks.

## Model Building
A baseline model is built using Linear Regression:

Data splitting: The training data is split into training and validation sets.
Model training: A linear regression model is fitted on the training data.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) on the validation set.
Cross-validation: Optionally, cross-validation is used for robust evaluation.
Other models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) can be explored for potential improvements.

## Submission
To generate the submission file:

Preprocess the test data using the same steps as for the training data.
Align the test data features with the training features.
Use the trained model to predict SalePrice for the test set.
Save the predictions in the required format, using sample_submission.csv as a template.
The final submission file is saved as submission.csv.
Example code is included in the repository.
